# Handover

Everything needed to pick this project up cold. Read this, then
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for status and [ECONOMICS.md](ECONOMICS.md) for the
contract.

---

## 0. Resume here after `/clear`

Read this section, then §8. Nothing else is needed to continue.

**State (2026-09-14).** `main` is pushed and CI is green; **v0.1.0 is tagged and
released** with the Android APK attached. 716 tests (39 red-team, 3 `#[ignore]`d
into the slow job), nine gates.

**Check a clean tree:** `bash scripts/check-all.sh` (nine gates, discovered by
glob) then `cargo nextest run --workspace`. Both must be green before a push.

**Tests are run by CI, or by `bash scripts/receipt.sh` on the Raspberry Pi or
the Freebox VM — never by AI agents.** The script runs the nine gates and every
test and prints a ten-line receipt; Nicolas pastes the receipt. While editing,
run only the crate being changed (`cargo nextest run -p <crate>`).

**Keep conversations short.** One task per conversation; update §0 and §8
before the context grows, then start a new one. Cost is measured, not guessed:
one long conversation re-read its own context 1,885 times.

**Traps that have cost real time:**
- Git Bash heredocs eat backslashes and turn `\r` into a carriage return. Write
  edit scripts with the Write tool into the scratchpad, then `python script.py`.
- Every red-team fix is **sabotage-verified**: revert the fix, watch its test
  fail, restore. A test that passes both ways is decorative and not accepted.
- A new test needs a catalogue row in `docs/TESTING.md` and the counts updated in
  README, ROADMAP and TESTING — `check-counts.py` fails otherwise, and its
  uncatalogued ceiling (116) is a ratchet, not a target.
- A new `scripts/check-*` file must get a step in `ci.yml` — `check-ci.py`.
- Unsafe code is allowed only in `crates/itsanas-drive/src/projfs.rs` (and the
  JNI export attribute), with a `SAFETY:` comment per block — `check-unsafe.py`.
- A PreToolUse hook (`~/.claude/hooks/quiet.py`) condenses builds and test runs
  to errors plus the summary and prints the full log path. Read that log rather
  than re-running. `QUIET=0 cmd` bypasses it.

**Where the truth is:** `docs/ROADMAP.md` "Known ceilings" and "What an
adversarial sweep found" (open findings, with arithmetic); `docs/ECONOMICS.md`
§1 (the 3:1 bargain is enforced locally only); `docs/DESIGN.md` §6.5–6.7
(verification cost against the 100 MB/day budget).

---

## 1. Where things are

```
D:\GitHub\itsanas
remote: https://github.com/SigSegGit/itsanas   (public, AGPL-3.0-or-later)
branch: main          tags: v0.1.0
CI:     .github/workflows/ci.yml — Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM, Android core,
        cargo deny, installers run on each OS
```

The fleet: this Windows laptop (a scheduled task named `ITSaNAS` runs the
daemon; its passphrase file is under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\itsanas`), a Raspberry Pi
4B running the coordinator, and an aarch64 VM on a Freebox Delta. Accounts and
addresses are in `install/README.md` and `docs/MVP.md`. **No secret belongs in
this repository**, including test machines' passphrases.

## 2. The invariant that keeps this honest

`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/TESTING.md` and `docs/ECONOMICS.md` are updated **in
the same commit as the code they describe**. If a document disagrees with the
code, the code is right and the document is a bug. Keep doing this.

**Tense discipline, which is the rule that stops the drift.** Present indicative
means *it runs today and a named test proves it*. Anything else carries a
visible marker — ECONOMICS.md has a legend at the top and every section is
tagged ✅ / 🟨 / ⬜. This exists because the failure mode is not lying, it is
elegance: a mechanism reads better in the present tense, so a document written
to decide what to build slides into describing it as built. That happened here —
`itsanas evict`, the anchor placement rule and challenge-based reputation were
all described as working before any of them existed, and one of them then
propagated into three other documents.

The practical test before committing a document: **for every present-tense
sentence, can you name the test or the function?** If not, mark it or cut it.

Documents organised by *state* (ROADMAP) do not drift, because the form has an
obvious place to write "not done". Documents organised by *mechanism*
(ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, ECONOMICS) drift, because they do not. That is a property
of the plan, not of anybody's attentiveness — which is why the markers are
mandatory rather than encouraged.

`scripts/check-catalogue.sh` fails if TESTING.md names a test that does not
exist, which has happened. It does not check the reverse — some crates are
catalogued by property rather than test by test — so a new test still has to be
written up by hand.

Test counts in TESTING.md are mechanical:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --list
```

That prints 464: **462 test functions across 17 binaries** (2 of them
`#[ignore]`d, which is the figure ROADMAP and TESTING both quote) **plus 2
doctests**. Quote the 462 and say what it excludes, or the number drifts.

## 3. Verify a clean tree in one go

Every gate CI runs, runnable locally:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features
cargo nextest run --profile ci --workspace --all-features   # 1 min per test, enforced
cargo test --doc --workspace --all-features                 # nextest skips doctests
cargo nextest run --release --workspace --all-features --run-ignored ignored-only
cargo +1.88.0 check --workspace --all-features          # MSRV
cargo deny --all-features check
bash scripts/check-rust.sh                              # fmt, clippy and rustdoc
python scripts/check-test-budget.py                     # the timeout is still enforced
bash scripts/check-catalogue.sh                         # docs/TESTING.md names real tests
```

All of these pass as of the last commit. **MSRV is 1.88** (let-chains), not the
1.85 that edition 2024 alone would need.

## 4. Crate layout and what each is for

```
crypto     identity, key schedule, sealing, blinded addressing, keystore
testkit    Alice/Bob/Carol — published test users, generated corpus, canaries
wire       length-prefixed framing + a generic Connection<S: Read + Write>
discover   signed UDP announcements on the local network; no server involved
policy     when and how much to sync — decided, tested, and used by the daemon
           yet: its consumer is the Android shell. `--metadata-only` reaches
           the mode by hand.
tls        anonymous TLS + device authentication bound to the channel
store      chunking, blob store, index, operation log, vault, version vectors
sync       version-vector merge, conflict resolution, convergence simulation
net        peer protocol, TLS transport, push/pull sessions
placement  rendezvous hashing (integer, no floats), repair planning
coord      device certificates, accounting, directory, protocol, server, client
coordinator  the `itsanas-coordinator` binary: address book and escrow locker
folder     a real directory mirrored into the store and back, with a watcher
cli        `itsanas` binary: commands + daemon
```

Dependency direction is strict: `crypto → store → sync → net → cli`, with
`wire`/`tls` beside them and `coord` deliberately unable to reach `store` or
`sync`.

## 5. Reading the code: a route, not a tour

Nobody reads 22 000 lines. This is the shortest path to the point where the rest
of the code stops surprising you — roughly two hours, in this order. Every file
listed has a module doc comment stating what it is for and what it refuses to
do; read those first and the bodies second.

| # | File | Lines | Why this one |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `crypto/src/kdf.rs` | 158 | The key schedule. Everything else derives from here, so it is the shortest file that changes how you read all the others. |
| 2 | `crypto/src/seal.rs` | 561 | Deterministic vs randomised sealing, and what goes into the associated data. The single most consequential design decision in the project — dedup, remote audit and blinded addressing all fall out of it. |
| 3 | `store/src/version.rs` | 310 | Version vectors and the dominance test. Every convergence property in the system is this file being right. |
| 4 | `folder/src/decision.rs` | 238 | `decide(on_disk, in_store, ledger)`, a pure function over three hashes with an exhaustive 27-case test. This is where "the folder syncs" actually happens, and it is small enough to hold in your head entirely. |
| 5 | `tls/src/auth.rs` | 182 | Why the device identity is not in the certificate. Short, and it is the whole transport security argument. |
| 6 | `store/src/oplog.rs` | 714 | Segments, chaining, and the tail-truncation gap documented at the top. Read the module comment even if you skip the body. |

After those six, the shape of everything else is predictable. `chunker.rs`,
`nodeset.rs` and `vault.rs` are each large but locally understandable, and
`accounting.rs` is pure integer arithmetic with [ECONOMICS.md](ECONOMICS.md) as
its commentary.

**What to read when you have to change something:** the tests. They are named as
sentences and [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) says what each one proves, so the fastest
way to learn what a module guarantees is its test module, not its body.

## 6. Decisions that must not be quietly reversed

Each of these has a test that fails if it is:

| Decision | Why | Guarded by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No floating point in placement or accounting | `f64::ln` is libm-dependent; two machines disagreeing in the last ulp about where a chunk lives is a silent, permanent split | `no_floating_point_is_involved` greps the module's own source |
| The FastCDC gear table is derived and pinned | If two devices disagree about boundaries, dedup silently stops network-wide | `the_gear_table_is_pinned_forever` |
| A delete is only acted on for a path the ledger says this device had | Otherwise a fresh device announces the deletion of everything its owner has | `a_brand_new_device_downloads_everything_and_deletes_nothing`, and an exhaustive 27-case matrix in `decision.rs` |
| Concurrent edits keep both, winner chosen by a deterministic total order | A rule two devices could disagree about makes them overwrite each other forever | `the_winner_is_the_same_whichever_side_asks` |
| A concurrent delete loses to an edit | An unexpected file costs a second; a lost edit is unrecoverable | `a_delete_racing_an_edit_never_destroys_the_edit` |
| The network never deletes data as a punishment | Total economic failure returns a member to a local backup, nothing worse | `only_default_permits_reclaiming_...` |
| Availability affects entitlement, never placement | The decision that risks data must not depend on the untrusted coordinator | ECONOMICS.md §3; placement takes no availability input |
| The vault takes no keys in any constructor | "A host cannot read what it stores" is structural, not a matter of nobody having written the call | `vault.rs` has no key parameter anywhere |
| Symlinks are skipped, never followed | A link to `~/.ssh` inside the folder would upload a private key | `symlinks_are_skipped_rather_than_followed` |
| Completing a handshake earns a peer nothing | Device keys are free keypairs, so authenticating identifies a peer and vouches for nothing. Treating it as trust turns the anti-flood measure into the flood's best tool | `red_team_a_flood_of_authenticating_strangers_cannot_take_over_the_table`, `red_team_a_peer_that_only_answered_the_phone_has_earned_nothing` |
| The user id is never broadcast, only a keyed tag of it | A user id is a public key; announcing it every 30 seconds on a café network tells the room whose machine this is | `red_team_the_user_id_never_appears_on_the_wire` |
| A replay of the vault happens only when a marker says work is outstanding | Unconditional replay turned the daemon's per-round cost from "the new segments" into "the whole chain, times the peers"; never replaying means deferred work is silently never retried | `a_round_that_deferred_nothing_does_not_replay_the_chain_next_time` |
| The holder ledger is kept in both key orders, written in one transaction | The two questions asked of it are range scans under opposite prefixes; one ordering makes the other a full table walk. Denormalised, and only defensible because every write and every removal touches both | `the_two_orderings_never_disagree_whatever_is_done_to_the_ledger` |
| Nothing walks a log chain without a bound | `segments_for` returns a `Vec`; an unlimited walk materialises a whole history in RAM. Found once already in `blobs().addresses()` | `catalogue::MAX_SEGMENTS_WALKED`, and `Catalogue::complete` says when a listing was truncated |
| An audit's questions are drawn at random, never ordered | Ordered selection is guessable, and one particular ordering — least recently confirmed first — degenerated into a *constant*, because a push round re-stamps a whole batch from one clock reading and the sort fell through to its tie-break. A host could keep the sixteen lowest chunk ids out of fourteen million and hold a spotless record | `red_team_the_same_question_is_not_asked_twice_every_round`; `red_team_a_host_that_keeps_only_what_it_expects_to_be_asked_is_caught` |
| A paused peer receives one chunk per round **and is audited on that chunk alone** | Its other records are the ones it is paused for, so drawing questions from them guarantees failure and makes the suspension a ban. The probe is written down when accepted, not inferred from a timestamp — "the newest record" is precisely the one an ordered audit never reaches | `a_paused_host_that_starts_answering_again_is_sent_data_again`; `a_probe_is_remembered_until_the_peer_answers_for_it` |
| Multi-chunk fixtures in every audit test | With one record on the ledger every selection rule picks the same thing, so a broken one looks correct. The way-back test used a 37-byte file and passed for two commits while the mechanism it named did not work | `a_file_of_many_chunks` in `tests/two_nodes.rs`, with a length assertion in each caller |
| A store written before a table existed is repaired on open, not read as empty | `chunks_to_challenge` reads the device-first ordering; on an older file it would return nothing, no audit would ever ask anything, and a node that has stopped checking its hosts looks exactly like one whose hosts are honest | `a_ledger_written_before_the_second_ordering_is_rebuilt_on_open` |
| A peer paused for failing audits still receives log segments | Segments are kilobytes and keep it able to relay for devices that have done nothing wrong; cutting it out of the log would punish them too | `a_paused_host_that_starts_answering_again_is_sent_data_again` |
| A failed storage challenge withdraws evidence and never destroys data | The rule in ECONOMICS.md §5 is that the network never deletes as a sanction; a host that fails an audit simply stops counting as a holder, and the chunk is re-sent | `red_team_a_host_that_threw_the_data_away_stops_counting_as_a_holder` |
| An audit never challenges on a chunk this device cannot verify | Verifying means re-deriving the sealed bytes locally; challenging without a local copy would withdraw an honest peer's record for a reason that is nothing to do with them | `an_audit_never_asks_about_a_chunk_it_could_not_check` |
| A listing shows files not downloaded, and never writes an index entry for one | An index entry means a readable file, which the conflict and delete logic both assume. Faking one is a bug nobody can locate later | `a_metadata_round_makes_the_file_listable_before_it_is_downloaded`; `catalogue.rs` derives, never records |
| A peer's own clock never decides ordering or expiry, anywhere | It is an attacker-controlled integer, and a Pi 4 with no RTC reports 1970. Made twice — in discovery, then again in the coordinator's peer list — and removed twice | `a_rebooted_pi_with_a_reset_clock_is_still_followed_to_its_new_address`; `CoordService::peers_of` uses `Directory::last_seen` |
| The escrow rate limit lives on the server, not the connection | Reconnecting costs a handshake and would buy a fresh budget, which is no budget | `red_team_reconnecting_does_not_reset_the_escrow_attempt_budget` |
| The sync schedule comes from `itsanas-policy`, never from a constant in a shell | Three shells with three numbers drift, and the argument for each number then lives nowhere. The daemon asks the policy and prints its reason; `--interval` overrides, `--metered` says what the connection costs | `a_service_on_ethernet_does_not_inherit_a_phone_s_interval`; `itsanas daemon` prints `because` |
| An enum with a decision table behind it exposes `ALL`, and the totality test walks it | A list of variants written out at the call site is one somebody forgets. `Attention::Unattended` was added and `every_combination_produces_a_plan_with_a_reason` went on checking the two it already knew, passing | `every_combination_produces_a_plan_with_a_reason` walks `Network::ALL`, `Power::ALL`, `Attention::ALL` |
| A peer is asked for a lost chunk only if the ledger already records it as holding that chunk | A repair request is a **disclosure**: it says this node no longer has that chunk. Blinded ids leak nothing about content, but "which chunks exist only on hosts now" is exactly the list to delete to destroy somebody's data. The first version asked every peer it connected to, including strangers discovery had just dialled | `red_team_a_stranger_is_not_told_which_chunks_this_node_has_lost` |
| Every detector of local loss writes to the same queue, and repair drains it before it samples | `doctor` knows the whole answer in one pass; the sampling scan needs fifty-five days to reach a given chunk on a terabyte. A human running `doctor` because a file will not open is the fastest detector here, and its answer used to go to a terminal and nowhere else | `what_doctor_finds_is_what_repair_fixes_first` |
| Anything that walks a large table from a cursor starts at a random point and wraps | Starting at the top means the first N entries are the only ones ever reached, and everything behind a run of unactionable ones starves for ever. Three places do this now — the audit draw, the repair scan, the loss queue — and the loss queue was written without it | `the_loss_queue_is_read_from_a_moving_start_and_wraps`; `every_holding_is_reachable_by_some_cursor` |
| A scoped thread that outlives a body which can panic raises its stop flag on unwind | Otherwise `thread::scope` joins a thread waiting on a flag the panic skipped. In a test that is a sixty-second hang instead of an assertion; in the daemon it is a process that stays alive, serving, never syncing, and looking healthy to systemd | `a_failing_assertion_inside_a_server_scope_fails_rather_than_hangs`; `a_panic_anywhere_in_the_scope_raises_the_shutdown_flag`; `UnblockOnDrop` in `handshake.rs` |
| A reply too large to be a chunk is refused on its length, before decryption | The wire allows 8 MiB and the chunker emits at most 256 KiB, so a peer answering every repair request at the frame limit would have this node decrypt a quarter of a gigabyte per round for a result known from the length | `a_reply_too_large_to_be_a_chunk_is_refused_without_decrypting_it` |
| The coordinator can refuse a member but never admit one | It is a notice board, not an authority. An invitation is signed by an existing member and verified against an account the coordinator already holds, so the one thing it can do unilaterally is deny service — which is already in the threat model and is inherent to being the notice board | `red_team_the_coordinator_cannot_write_itself_an_invitation` |
| Every refusal at the door reads identically | Distinguishing "no such code" from "expired" from "spent" lets anybody enumerate which codes exist, and the codes are what keeps strangers out | `every_refusal_reads_the_same_so_codes_cannot_be_enumerated` |
| **Nothing makes `has_chunk` true without proof** | The rule, in one line, because it existed as two methods with two different answers and the unverified one was on the ordinary path. A blob on disk under an address is how every other part of this system decides it need not go looking: write noise there and the repair scan stops searching, no other peer is asked, and the loss queue clears the entry `doctor` put in it. A recoverable loss made permanent, which is strictly worse than the peer refusing to answer | `red_team_a_relay_cannot_poison_a_chunk_on_the_ordinary_pull_path`; `red_team_a_host_cannot_answer_a_repair_request_with_rubbish`; one method, `Store::accept_chunk` |
| A chunk fetched to repair a local loss is verified before it is written | Unverified bytes make `has_chunk` true, the scan stops looking, no other peer is ever asked, and a **recoverable** loss becomes permanent. A host cannot read what it stores, so answering a repair request with noise is its one route to destroying data | `red_team_a_host_cannot_answer_a_repair_request_with_rubbish` |
| A test harness that runs a server stops it when the body panics | Otherwise `thread::scope` joins an accept loop nothing shut down and the suite reports a hang. Every red-team test in `two_nodes.rs` runs inside that harness, so a test catching an attack reported a timeout — which everybody retries and nobody reads | `a_failing_assertion_inside_a_server_scope_fails_rather_than_hangs`; `StopOnDrop` in `two_nodes.rs` and `coordinator.rs` |
| A replication target counts this device | Off by one means the repair loop keeps two copies while reporting three, invisibly, until two machines die instead of three | `a_target_counts_this_device_so_three_asks_for_two_elsewhere` |
| A peer is recorded as a holder only when it accepted or already had the chunk | Recording a refusal as storage is indistinguishable from safety until the local disk dies | `a_host_that_refuses_to_store_is_not_recorded_as_holding_anything` |
| A discovery beacon's address comes from the UDP source, never from the packet | A self-declared address lets any node redirect traffic to a machine that is not it | `a_new_device_is_recorded_with_the_address_it_was_heard_from` |
| The discovery table is bounded and confirmed peers are protected | Device ids are free keypairs, so a flood is cheap; without this it evicts the machines that matter | `a_flood_of_strangers_cannot_evict_a_known_peer`, `the_table_never_grows_past_its_capacity` |
| The sender's clock decides nothing in discovery | A Pi 4 has no RTC and boots in 1970; superseding by sender clock strands it at a stale address | `a_rebooted_pi_with_a_reset_clock_is_still_followed_to_its_new_address` |
| Streaming boundaries match slice boundaries exactly | Otherwise one file stored via two paths dedups against nothing | `streaming_and_slicing_agree_on_every_boundary` |
| Published test identities are refused by `Store::open` | Their phrases are in the docs | `the_published_test_identities_are_refused_...` |

## 7. What is built and working

Detail and measurements are in ROADMAP.md; this is the map.

- **Core**: content-defined chunking, sealed blinded chunks, transactional index,
  signed chained log, version vectors and conflict siblings, GC with grace.
- **Network**: TLS 1.3 with device-key channel binding; peer protocol with a
  version window; storage challenges on a random sample; a per-(chunk, device)
  holder ledger with freshness; **releasing local data requires two holders that
  have answered a challenge**; 256-bucket set reconciliation so an idle round
  sends one hash; repair from peers with every byte verified.
- **Coordinator**: server and CLI, invite-only admission, one key one account,
  escrow of a sealed recovery container. The accounting *rules* exist; nothing on
  the network applies them (§8.1).
- **Machines that hold less than the account**: `itsanas keep` budgets with an
  ordering, selective fetch, `itsanas space` bounded by disk and pledge.
- **Front ends**: folder daemon with watcher; Android app (Compose over JNI,
  emulator only); Windows virtual drive over ProjFS (read-only).
- **Installers** for Linux, Windows, macOS, Termux and the coordinator, each with
  `--clean` delegating to one uninstaller. Run for real on the Pi, the VM and
  Windows; macOS in CI.

## 8. What is next, in order

1. **Enforce the space split. Asked for by Nicolas on 2026-09-14; the first
   task of the next conversation.** Nothing enforces it today. Verified facts:

   - The ratio is `itsanas-coord::accounting::CONTRIBUTION_RATIO = 3`: keep one
     byte per three pledged, a **25/75** split. Nicolas asked for **30/70**. That
     is a ratio of 7/3, below the replication factor of 3: three copies of every
     byte with only 2.33 bytes of pledged room behind them, a network-wide
     deficit of about 22 %. **Confirm the number with him before changing the
     default.** Make it a value either way — he wants it to become a setting.
   - It is read by `accounting.rs` (`room_earned`, `pledge_needed_for`), the CLI
     `keep`, `space` and `pledge` (`crates/itsanas-cli/src/main.rs`, around lines
     1770–2060), the Android JNI `setKeep`/`setPledge`
     (`crates/itsanas-android/src/lib.rs`, around 551–622), the coordinator claim
     (`crates/itsanas-cli/src/coordinator.rs:180`) and the daemon's `Pledge`
     (`crates/itsanas-cli/src/daemon.rs`).
   - **Writing never consults it.** `Store::write_stream` and `write_file`
     (`crates/itsanas-store/src/store.rs`, ~246 and ~310) and the folder import
     (`crates/itsanas-folder/src/lib.rs`, ~259) accept any amount: an account's
     size is bounded by nothing.
   - **Hosts bound themselves, not owners.** `would_exceed_pledge`
     (`crates/itsanas-net/src/service.rs`) stops a host exceeding its own
     pledge; nothing limits what one owner stores on a host, so a rebuilt client
     that pledges nothing is served until every host is full.
   - `accounting::assess()` and the coordinator's usage path run only in tests.

   Build in this order, each step with a red-team test that is sabotage-verified:

   a. **The split as a value.** A `Split { own, network }` type in
      `accounting.rs` holding today's default, a config field that overrides it,
      and every reader above going through it. No behaviour change; tests prove
      the default equals today's numbers.
   b. **Bound writes on the honest client.** `write_stream` and the folder
      import refuse when account bytes plus the incoming file exceed the room the
      pledge earns (the joining allowance for the first thirty days), and when
      this machine's own store plus its pledge would exceed the disk. The error
      names the numbers, in the wording `itsanas space` already uses.
   c. **Bound owners on the host — the part a rebuilt client cannot delete.**
      In `service.rs` `StoreChunk` and `StoreSegment`: a host stores for owner O
      at most an allowance plus `k ×` the bytes of this host's own data that O's
      devices have **proved** they hold (a passed storage challenge, as
      `Store::release` already requires). Attribute a device to its owner through
      the owner-signed `NodeClaim`, never the unauthenticated `Hello` field. Tests:
      a peer hosting nothing is refused past the allowance; a peer that hosts and
      passes audits keeps being served.
   d. `ECONOMICS.md` §1 back to built when (c) lands, §8 constants, catalogue
      rows, counts.

2. **Finish the red team, one surface per session, by hand.** Three surfaces have
   never been examined — every multi-agent attempt died on usage limits:
   *integrity* (a hostile peer: forged or replayed segments, version vectors that
   win or resurrect deletions, chunks whose id does not match their bytes,
   downgrade past a later defence), *confidentiality* (convergent ciphertext, what
   two hosts learn by comparing notes), *identity* (many devices, claiming someone
   else's device, LAN discovery eclipse). Git history was checked for secrets on
   2026-09-14 and is clean.
3. **The open findings** listed in ROADMAP.md: a refused request still walks the
   whole vault; one peer can hold the single-threaded listener; `pledge` and the
   JNI setters skip the ratio check; chunk-size sequences fingerprint files; the
   LAN beacon groups an account's machines.
4. **Verification at a terabyte.** Within a differing bucket, ask only about
   chunks with no fresh record for that peer (DESIGN.md §6.5). Today the budget
   buys about 3 MB of change a day at 1 TB.
5. **A real phone**, and a release signing key for the APK that Nicolas holds
   (v0.1.0 ships with the development key).

## 9. Known gaps, deliberately open

- **Tail truncation.** A host can serve an internally consistent *prefix* of a
  segment chain. Detecting it needs signed, timestamped head records gossiped
  between peers. Documented at the top of `store/src/oplog.rs`.
- **Usage is self-reported.** A member who under-reports gains entitlement they
  have not earned. Verifiable usage needs hosts to report what they hold.
- **Storage challenges prove possession at a moment**, not continuously, and a
  host that fetches from another replica just in time passes.
- **No bandwidth accounting.** 10 TB on a 1 Mbit uplink is worth far less than
  the number says. Deferred because measuring it badly punishes people for their
  ISP.
- **One process per node.** The index is under an exclusive lock, so commands
  refuse to run while the daemon holds it. A local control socket is the fix.
- **The escrow attempt counters are in memory only.** A coordinator restart
  clears every one of them, so anybody who can provoke a restart — or who simply
  waits for one — gets a fresh budget. Persisting them is the fix; the Argon2id
  cost is what carries the weight until then.
- **A stale address is handed out for a week.** `PRESENCE_TTL` bounds it, but
  every peer pays a dial for every stale entry until it expires.
- **The blob layout does not reach a terabyte.** Measured, not suspected: see
  [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) M9. One file per chunk is 14.7 million files per
  terabyte, and `blobs().addresses()` walks all of them on every sync round.
  Pack files are the decided answer, scheduled after the coordinator because
  M9's third measurement showed the *daily* experience is already fine — a Word
  document saves in 29 ms on the laptop and 10 ms on the aarch64 VM; the
  small machine wins because a save is dominated by one file per chunk.
- **No file-level sharing between users.** Not needed for mutual storage;
  `UserKeys::agree` exists, is tested, and is deliberately unused until it is.

## 10. Open, waiting on Nicolas

1. **Who joins next.** The network has one person. Every economic and
   adversarial property above is untested against someone else's machine.
2. **An Android release key.** It must be generated and kept by Nicolas, never
   committed; the APK cannot be upgraded in place across a key change.
3. **How the bargain is enforced**: bilateral ledgers between hosts, or the
   coordinator computing standings. ECONOMICS.md argues for the first.

## 11. Working style Nicolas expects

- Blunt assessments. Say "you are wrong here" and then show why.
- Tests must state what they would catch. A test whose failure message does not
  name a consequence is a bad test.
- Comments explain *why*, never *what*.
- Keep docs synchronised in the same commit.
- Decide alone and proceed; flag the decision rather than asking permission for
  routine calls.
- Code for a Raspberry Pi and an unreliable network: bounded memory, no
  assumption that any machine is up.

An adversarial audit persona (`anthropic-skills:rodin`, French, blunt) has been
used twice on this project and found real gaps both times. Worth repeating after
each substantial milestone.
